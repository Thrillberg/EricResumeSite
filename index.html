				<h4>I'm a chronic student</h4>
					<p>I've been a student for most of my life. I know how it feels to not know something one day and dive into it the next. After all, it wasn't that long ago that I began my journey with programming in Ruby. While I've done many different things in my time (from being a professional musician to working for a book publisher to working at a biology lab to tutoring elementary and high school students), a recurring feature of all of my ventures has been the constant learning curve. My enthusiasm for being a student, one who constantly looks for new things to learn, is my greatest asset. I prefer not to continue doing the same routine work, when there are opportunities to learn new and better ways.</p>

				<h4>I'm a people-person</h4>
					<p>Any engineering team needs people who can take a project and make it their own, while paying keen attention to the needs of the product manager and, ultimately, the end consumer. I have a history of conceiving and executing projects, proving my ability to take ownership and responsibility for the product. My extensive history of communication with stakeholders of all sorts, from senior administrators to customers to orchestra conductors, shows my empathy and ability to see through others' eyes, including clients.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="col-md-4">
				<h4>I'm passionate about education</h4>
					<p><b>Panorama's</b> engineer position feeds into my interests on multiple levels. As a company in the education field, the industry is fitting; as a member of a valued team, I have confidence that the learning curve will remain sharp; as a novel approach to bringing data to education, the innovation plays into my ambition for positive change in the world. The benefits for me will be returned to <b>Panorama</b> manifold as my contributions will be fueled by sustained and inspired vigor. While analyzing data can be useful, the real value comes in applying the data to real problems. I deeply admire <b>Panorama's</b> dual mission of interpreting student outcomes in data and then bringing that data back to schools so that they can improve practices.</p>

				<h4>About Me</h4>
					<p>I've done a lot of things and lived a lot of places. I'm a web developer currently learning all I can about the various technologies. I expect this won't change.</p>

					<p>In my free time I play board games. I play too much <a href="http://playgo.to/iwtg/en/">Go</a>. My ranking is AGA 4 kyu and KGS 5 kyu. I also play <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplomacy_%28game%29">Diplomacy</a>.</p>

				<h4>My Projects</h4>
					<p>I have done a few small student projects. The most recent one is a Mood and Sentiment Analyzer, the code of which can be found <b><a href="https://github.com/Thrillberg/mood-and-sentiment-analyzer">here</a></b>. I gave a couple talks about the Mood and Sentiment Analyzer in New Haven, CT and New York City. It has no web presence yet. The other one is <b><a href="http://sainttracker.heroku.com">Saint Tracker</a></b></p>
					<p>Code for these projects (and others!) can be found on my <a href="www.github.com/thrillberg">Github</a> page. Feel free to check it out!
